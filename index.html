         <h3><b>Rebel Poet</b></h3>
          <p>
            Born into a Bengali Muslim Kazi family hailing from Burdwan district in Bengal Presidency (now in West Bengal),[2] Nazrul Islam received religious education and as a young man worked as a muezzin at a local mosque. He learned about poetry, drama, and literature while working with the rural theatrical group Letor Dal, Leto being a folk song genre of West Bengal[11] usually performed by the people from Muslim community of the region. He joined the British Indian Army in 1917 and was posted in Karachi. Nazrul established himself as a journalist in Calcutta after the war ended. He criticised the British Raj and called for revolution through his poetic works, such as "Bidrohi"

          <h3><b>Awesome Writer</b></h3>
          <p>
            Nazrul wrote and composed music for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded on HMV and gramophone records),[22] collectively known as Nazrul Geeti. In 1942 at the age of 43, he began to suffer from an unknown disease, losing his voice and memory. A medical team in Vienna diagnosed the disease as Pick's disease,[23] a rare incurable neurodegenerative disease. It caused Nazrul's health to decline steadily and forced him to live in isolation. He was also admitted in Ranchi (Jharkhand) psychiatric hospital for many years. At the invitation of the Government of Bangladesh, Nazrul's family took him to Bangladesh and moved to Dhaka in 1972.
